	  <details ><summary>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the new farm bill? How will it modernise or destroy the farmers?</summary><p>New Farm Bill is a proposal of the government which is not only opposed by the opposition, but also opposed by the 25 years long-lasting friend of BJP, the Akali Dal. There are three points in these reforms:

		Farmers can store the food grains and can sell them when ever they want.
		Companies and farmers can trade with each other directly. No need to sell the agricultural product only in mandis.

	  <details ><summary>How can India empower its farmers?</summary><p>India's farmers started getting empowered from the 1950s. The first, and game changing, step was abolition of zamindari and re-distribution of land to cultivators. The second game changer was providing access to finance by PSU banks, starting from 1969. Around that time, we developed the high yield seeds which raised agriculture productivity by many times. And most of the major crops are supported by pricing floors.</p></details><br>

	  <details ><summary>What are the causes for low agricultural productivity in India?</summary><p>The entire society is suffering from low productivity, poor quality, adulteration, kamchori, rent seeking , corruption and copying from west

		Do you think industrial and babudom productivity is good ?
		
		Workers are part time or migratory
		
		Physically also not as strong as western population
		
		Mechanisation is low since limited budget is plunderd by crony capitalists politicians criminlas and babus(police included)
		
		Not ony that , our 50% farmers still depend on monsoon.India either faces floods or drought even today
		
		We are still importing fertilisers after closing most central govt plants
